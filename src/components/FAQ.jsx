      answer: "WalletX offers revolutionary multi-wallet generation supporting both temporary and permanent wallets using BIP39/BIP44 standards.

    },
    {
      question: "What is the smart contract escrow system and how secure is it?",

The system includes timeout and refund protocols, allowing senders to recover funds from unclaimed escrows, making it perfect for freelance payments, marketplace transactions, or any situation requiring trusted fund management."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the integrated faucets work?",

    },
    {
      question: "What advanced transaction controls are available?",
      answer: "WalletX provides manual gas limit and gas price control for advanced transaction management.

All transactions include detailed confirmations and status tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI chatbot assistance work?",

This ensures both beginners and advanced users can maximize the platform's capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "What are temporary wallets and when should I use them?",
      answer: "Temporary wallets are like disposable phone numbers for cryptocurrency - perfect for testing, development, privacy-focused transactions, escrow agreements, airdrops, or when you need instant blockchain access without compromising your main wallets. You can generate unlimited HD wallets from a single seed phrase or create fresh ones as needed, providing maximum privacy and security for specific use cases."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is WalletX and where are my private keys stored?",
      answer: "WalletX employs enterprise-grade security with complete client-side cryptographic operations. Your private keys never leave your browser and are stored locally with encryption. We use industry-standard BIP-39/BIP-44 compliance, Web Crypto API for secure random generation, and maintain a zero data collection policy. All cryptographic operations happen locally using ethers.js and secure smart contract interactions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I import existing wallets from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or other wallets?",
      answer: "Yes! WalletX supports importing existing wallets using 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrases with full BIP-39 validation and cross-platform compatibility. Since we use standard derivation paths, wallets imported from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and other standard wallets work seamlessly. Your existing wallet addresses will be identical due to our BIP-44 compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "Is WalletX completely free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, WalletX is completely free and open source. There are no subscription fees, hidden costs, or premium features. You only pay standard blockchain network fees (gas fees) when making transactions or using escrow services. All features including multi-chain support, QR code functionality, escrow system, faucet access, and AI assistance are available at no cost."
    },
    {
      question: "How does WalletX ensure compatibility with existing DeFi and Web3 applications?",
      answer: "WalletX uses industry-standard cryptographic methods: BIP-39 for mnemonic generation, BIP-44 for hierarchical derivation, EIP-155 for chain IDs, and EIP-1559 for gas fees. This ensures full compatibility with all major wallet providers and Web3 applications. WalletX-generated wallets work seamlessly with DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and dApps on Somina network, with the integrated escrow system enabling secure DeFi interactions."
